# Assistocat Chrome extension

## Overview

This Chrome extenstion adds several tweaks in GitHub web UI to make
developers collaboration easier by reducing number of inconvinient or
repetitive manipulation on a page.

It is inspired by [Vasiliy Ermolovich](https://github.com/nashby) and
his extension [jose-vs-oss](https://github.com/nashby/jose-vs-oss). He
attempts to help [Jose Valim](https://github.com/josevalim) to spend
less time writing comments on pull requests in OSS projects.

His idea is taken further here to help not only Jose but other GitHub
users as well.
